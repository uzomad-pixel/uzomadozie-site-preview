            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Uzoma Dozie</strong> — entrepreneur, investor and founder of <em>Sparkle</em>, a digital bank reimagining how individuals and small businesses manage money in Nigeria.</p>
            <p>I believe technology, when built with empathy, has the power to unlock human potential, drive inclusion and transform societies. My work has always been about people first, technology second.</p>

            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <div class="journey-item">
                <h3>Banking Roots</h3>
                <p>I began my career in finance, eventually becoming CEO of <strong>Diamond Bank</strong>, one of Nigeria’s leading commercial banks. My mission there was simple: bring banking closer to the people, and people closer to opportunities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="journey-item">
                <h3>The Sparkle Story</h3>
                <p>After Diamond Bank merged with Access Bank, I started <strong>Sparkle</strong> — a fully digital microfinance bank. With Sparkle, I wanted to create more than a bank: a platform where people and businesses could access financial services, tools and community all in one place. From payroll and invoicing to lending and group savings (Esusu), Sparkle is about working smart, not just hard.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="journey-item">
                <h3>Investor &amp; Mentor</h3>
                <p>Beyond Sparkle, I invest in and mentor startups across Africa — from fintech and lifestyle to retail and technology. I believe in backing founders who are solving real problems in new ways.</p>

            <h2>Ideas That Drive Me</h2>
            <ul class="ideas-list">
                <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> Access shouldn’t be a privilege. Everyone deserves the tools to thrive.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology with Empathy:</strong> Tech is powerful, but only if it makes life simpler and more human.</li>
                <li><strong>People &gt; Products:</strong> Businesses succeed when they build trust and put people at the center.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning &amp; Curiosity:</strong> Whether it’s through conversations, photography or travel — I’m always learning and sharing.</li>

        <section class="beyond-work container">
            <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
            <p>When I’m not speaking at conferences, writing or building businesses, you’ll probably find me behind a <strong>camera lens</strong>. Photography allows me to slow down, notice the small details and connect with the world in a different way.</p>
            <p>I’m also passionate about <strong>storytelling</strong> — whether through blogs, videos or conversations with entrepreneurs. For me, every interaction is an opportunity to learn, share and spark change.</p>
